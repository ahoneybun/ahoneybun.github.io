## Preface

I purchased this system from [Amazon's Renewed Store](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVWKM463?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details#renewedProgramDescriptionBtfSection) and the listing for this model is also in that link if you wanted to purchase it after this review. 

### Battery

### Touchpad

It is a joy to use though it would be nicer if it was a little larger though perhaps that'll happen if they make a 14" or larger model (this is 13.3"). It is certainly larger then my last laptop that I purchased and used for years (still do as a great backup machine).

### Camara

This part is short as I'm not able to detect it with any software that I can find like camaeractrls, websites and such.
