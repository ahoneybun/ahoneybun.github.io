## New and updated packages in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)!

With the launch of the new [System76 Thelio Astra](https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-astra) we saw some updated system76 packages such as 

- [system76-power](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/350954) 
- [system76-io-dkms](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/350933)

but system76-io-dkms update also added support for the [Thelio Io v2](https://github.com/system76/thelio-io).

We also saw the first Alpha, second and third  Alpha of the COSMIC packages that I (co)-maintain in nixpkgs though some skipped Alpha 2 going right from Alpha 1 to Alpha 3.

I would like to highlight the help from the following people who have helped me with my work in nixpkgs:

- [lilyinstarlight](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight)
- [a-kenji](https://github.com/a-kenji)

We have had 11 releases of the System76 Keyboard Configurator for the Arch Linux AUR package! For those who don't know you can use this on the [System76 Launch](https://system76.com/keyboards/) and Intel [System76 Laptops](https://system76.com/laptops)!
