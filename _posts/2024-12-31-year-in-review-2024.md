## New and updated packages in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)!

With the launch of the new [System76 Thelio Astra](https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-astra) we saw some updated system76 packages such as 

- [system76-power](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/350954) 
- [system76-io-dkms](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/350933)

but this update of the system76-io-dkms package in nixpkgs also added support for the [Thelio Io v2](https://github.com/system76/thelio-io) which is helpful for newer Thelio's that use that version of the board.

We also saw the first Alpha, second and third  Alpha of the COSMIC packages that I (co)-maintain in nixpkgs though some skipped Alpha 2 going right from Alpha 1 to Alpha 3.

I would like to highlight the help from the following people who have helped me with my work in nixpkgs:

- [nyabinary](https://github.com/nyabinary)
- [lilyinstarlight](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight)
- [a-kenji](https://github.com/a-kenji)

We have had 11 releases of the System76 Keyboard Configurator for the Arch Linux AUR package! For those who don't know you can use this on the [System76 Launch](https://system76.com/keyboards/) and Intel [System76 Laptops](https://system76.com/laptops)!

## COSMIC Utils Org

[Ed](https://github.com/edfloreshz) and I have formed the [COSMIC Utils Org](https://github.com/cosmic-utils) which has over 10 awesome folks (including ourselves) which is to have 3rd party COSMIC applications and applets in one place so that developers can help each other improve their application and/or applet or create one news!

### Stellarshot

This project also includes our own application called [Stellarshot](https://github.com/cosmic-utils/stellarshot) which is a backup tool for COSMIC using rustic on the backend to handle the snapshots which are also encrypted!
