## Walled Gardens

When most folks moved or at least created accounts on a Mastodon instance they did so when Musk took over in fear of what he would do, some were already there long before then. We "escaped" to the greener and more open side where folks were usually nicer to each other (unless you are on or federate with instances that let anything go including hate speech and such). 

## Adding Guards

Now with the launch of Meta's Threads which can use ActivityPub folks are looking at the idea of sealing themselves away by blocking basically another instance. Now this can seem good from the outside and in what I believe is the true meaning of open source you can choose to not federate with their servers but I think asking what your users want is also important such as what the folks on the [instance that I'm on](https://creatorstudio.space/@sysop/110667902051590789) are doing.
